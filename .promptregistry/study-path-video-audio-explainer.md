# Study-Path to NotebookLM Explainer

Overview
Create a short, structured learning path for any field, then turn it into a clear video or audio explanation. The user will provide the **topic/field** and optionally a rough description of **stages** or available materials.

Study-Path Structure (5 Stages Example)
Use this as a template; adapt names or count if needed.

Stage 1 – Orientation: Framing the Problem
- Goal: Describe the problem in plain language: what to improve, which decisions exist, and what uncertainties or open questions matter.
- Core ideas: high-level performance goals; main decision types; main sources of uncertainty or variability.
- Typical resources: non-technical overviews (intro blog, talk, executive summary).
- Checkpoints: 2–3 simple questions checking that the learner can restate goals, decisions, and uncertainties.

Stage 2 – Core Concepts: Fundamental Modeling/Conceptual Framework
- Goal: Learn the small set of core concepts used to formally describe problems in this field.
- Core ideas: key objects (e.g., states/variables), actions/choices, external inputs, and what is being optimized or evaluated.
- Typical resources: introductory chapter, gentle tutorial, or video explaining the main framework.
- Checkpoints: 2–3 questions asking the learner to list the core elements and distinguish their roles in words.

Stage 3 – Method Fundamentals: Main Method Families
- Goal: Understand the major families of methods/approaches used in the field and when to use them.
- Core ideas: 2–4 method families, their intuition, and high-level trade-offs.
- Typical resources: overview paper/chapter or talk comparing method types.
- Checkpoints: 2–3 questions contrasting approaches and identifying which method fits a simple example.

Stage 4 – Applied Methods: Simple Examples & Practice
- Goal: See how the main methods are applied on simple, illustrative examples.
- Core ideas: small worked examples, simple rules/procedures, basic tuning or configuration.
- Typical resources: teach-by-example chapters, simple case studies, or beginner-friendly code/tutorials.
- Checkpoints: 2–3 tasks such as "describe a toy example", "name a simple rule", or "explain why a configuration belongs to a given method family".

Stage 5 – Advanced Topics: Complexity & Limits
- Goal: Understand when basic methods fail and why more advanced ideas and richer modeling are needed.
- Core ideas: advanced methods, deeper sources of difficulty (e.g., high dimensionality, long horizons, complex uncertainty), and typical limitations.
- Typical resources: advanced chapters, survey sections on challenges, or introductory material on frontier techniques.
- Checkpoints: 2–3 questions asking when advanced methods are needed, what extra complexity they handle, and what their main challenges are.

Task
Using the user-provided topic/field (and any materials or stage hints they share):
1. Instantiate this 5-stage template (or a similar 3–5 stage structure) for that specific topic.
2. For each stage, briefly fill in: goal, core ideas, typical resource types, and 2–3 example checkpoint questions.
3. Then, draft a short script outline for a **video or audio explanation** that walks through the stages in order, highlighting goals, core ideas, and example checkpoints in a conversational, learner-friendly tone.
