# Project Plan

## Objectives
- Create an application to simplify access to SQL data through natural language querying.
- Python-based application using Streamlit, Langchain/Langgraph and Plotly.
- Streamlit should be used as the main interface.
- Langchain/Langgraph to develop the agent that will capture the query an interface with the DB.
- At the end, there should be the option to visualize the output using plotly within streamlit.

## Architecture
- Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns.
- Comprehensive testing suite using Pytest.

## Development Strategy
- Follow agile methodologies with iterative development cycles.
- Maintain clear documentation and task tracking.
