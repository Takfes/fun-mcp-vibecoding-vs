## Prompt: Codebase Exploration and Understanding

* Focus explicitly on the part(s) of the codebase specified in the request.
* If the scope is large or unclear, start with a high-level structural overview to establish context.
* Map how the requested part connects to other modules, components, or workflows.
* For each relevant file or function. Explain its purpose, inputs/outputs, and how it fits into the larger system.
* Proactively elaborate on complex logic, design trade-offs, or non-obvious behaviors.
* Keep the explanation concise but complete. Avoid skipping over technical depth for brevity.
