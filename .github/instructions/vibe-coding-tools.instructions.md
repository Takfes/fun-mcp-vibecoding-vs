# Vibe Coding Prompt

Initiate the development process by:

- Always start by reading PLAN.md to understand project goals and architecture.
- Use sequential-thinking MCP to break down work into clear, step-by-step tasks.
- Log and update all tasks in TASKS.md; mark completed tasks but never delete them.
- Implement tasks one at a time, update the code, and document all changes in WRITEME.md.
- Before coding, use context7 MCP to retrieve any needed documentation or references.
- Follow project standards and guidelines consistently throughout the process.
